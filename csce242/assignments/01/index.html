        <p>Turtles are fascinating reptiles with hard shells that protect them. These shells are made of bone and covered in scutes, similar to human nails. They're found in oceans, rivers, and on land, and they move slowly while often living for over 100 years.
        </p>
        <p>Having existed for over 200 million years, turtles are some of the oldest reptiles. Most eat plants and algae, but some also consume insects or small animals. They play a vital role in ecosystems by helping to keep aquatic environments healthy. However, they face threats from habitat loss and poaching, making conservation efforts essential to ensure their survival.
